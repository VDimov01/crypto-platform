# crypto-platform
JS Backend Project

Tech stack: MongoDB, Express, Node.js

The html and css was provided. The functionality was implemented by me.

Simple catalog for cryptocurrencies with authentication and authorization.

The app has input validation and route guards.

If you are logged in user you can add your own cryptocurrency offers and edit/delete them and you can see the cryptocurrencies catalog and the cryptocurrency details as well. If you dont own the offer you can buy the cryptocurrency.

If you are a guest you can see the catalog and the cryptocurrency details but you can't edit/delete them (only the cube owner can do this!) and you can't buy them as well.
